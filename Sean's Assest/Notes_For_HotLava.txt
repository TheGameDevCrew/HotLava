Notes For adding the New_Throw script to the scene


1.  Make sure a projectice and target are placed in the scene

2.  Attach these to the new throw "Target" and "Projectile"
    part of the script in the Inspector

3.  Set firing Angle to 30 and Gravity to 50 for a nice throw
    (This can be adjusted in the inspector to get the right
     feel)

And that should be all you need to make the throw work.

I am attaching crosshair assest with my files that you can
use as a Target
